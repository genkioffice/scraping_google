  Advertisement auto play on middle of a fight? Really mo****f*****?    
  When I first play I join as guest to play and I have been play for a while then I decided to connect it using my Facebook,  but turn out it overwrite my guest I'd and I lost my previous battle and it feel I like starting a new account,  I want it to be recover cuz it suck,  And actually I like this game.  But this is annoying.    
  It's very fun and easy to play
